#teager energy operator

dr=librosa.get_duration(filename='*.wav')
ldr=dr-1
for i in range(2):(ldr)
    
    x(i) = sr(i) ^2 - sr(i-1) * sr(i+1)
end
TE=x(i)
print("teager energy operator",TE)

where i used dr as length of the wave file and sr is the main sourche file 
After using for loop the below mentioned error message is showing and i m confused what to do if anyone can help plz suggest.
